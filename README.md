### Clustering Project:

**Part I: Image Decoloring with K-means**
- Implement K-means clustering to reduce the number of colors in an image, effectively decoloring it and creating a visually simplified version.

**Part II: Find an Optimal Clustering for a Dataset**
- Use K-means clustering to initially segment the dataset, then apply Hierarchical Clustering to refine and evaluate the optimal grouping of data points.
