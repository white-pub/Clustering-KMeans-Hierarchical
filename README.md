**Note**: There is some issue with properly displaying the jupyter notebook on GitHub natively. 
You can view the fully rendered Jupyter Notebook on nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/white-pub/Clustering-KMeans-Hierarchical/blob/main/Assignment6_Clustering.ipynb).

### Clustering Project:

**Part I: Image Decoloring with K-means**
- Implement K-means clustering to reduce the number of colors in an image, effectively decoloring it and creating a visually simplified version.

**Part II: Find an Optimal Clustering for a Dataset**
- Use K-means clustering to initially segment the dataset, then apply Hierarchical Clustering to refine and evaluate the optimal grouping of data points.
